# CropTag
Crop tag is utility to create tags on image for cropping

# History
This utility was created by me during early days of my career when I was trying to solve a simple problem of creating tags over an image and sending coordinates to a server side program for cropping (along with image data). The project remained archived in my google drive folder until finally I decided to rethink and rewrite the utility for all of you wonderful folks out there. Let me know what you think!

# Install

```sh
npm i croptag
```
